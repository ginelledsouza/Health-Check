# Health Check : Chest X-ray Classification
The following repository consists of a jupyter notebook that classifies whether or not a person is suffering from pneumonia.<br>
As we went through the images we realized that the dataset consists of a majority of Xrays that were affected by pneumonia. This causes a bias in the prediction of the model as the model assumes that the majority of the images will always be affected by pneumonia. It is a need that we normalize this situation for better results. However, this repository does not normalize the images before data modeling.<br>

The dataset to this is freely available on Kaggle through the following link:
